      <h2>7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
        Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your
        privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
        do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
        a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
        this Privacy Policy.
